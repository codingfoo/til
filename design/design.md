## Summary of key rules

The four most im­por­tant ty­po­graph­ic choic­es you make in any doc­u­ment are point size, line spacing, line length, and font (pas­sim), be­cause those choic­es de­ter­mine how the body text looks.

point size should be 10–12 points in print­ed doc­u­ments, 15-25 pix­els on the web.

line spacing should be 120–145% of the point size.

The average line length should be 45–90 char­ac­ters (in­clud­ing spaces).

The eas­i­est and most vis­i­ble im­prove­ment you can make to your ty­pog­ra­phy is to use a pro­fes­sion­al font, like those found in font recommendations.

Avoid goofy fonts, mono­spaced fonts, and sys­tem fonts, especially times new roman and Arial.

Use curly quo­ta­tion marks, not straight ones (see straight and curly quotes).

Put only one space be­tween sentences.

Don’t use multiple word spaces or other white-space characters in a row.

Never use underlining, un­less it’s a hyperlink.

Use cen­tered text sparingly.

Use bold or italic as lit­tle as possible.

all caps are fine for less than one line of text.

If you don’t have real small caps, don’t use them at all.

Use 5–12% extra letterspacing with all caps and small caps.

kerning should al­ways be turned on.

Use first-line indents that are one to four times the point size of the text, or use 4–10 points of space be­tween para­graphs. But don’t use both.

If you use justified text, also turn on hyphenation.

Don’t confuse hy­phens and dashes, and don’t use mul­ti­ple hy­phens as a dash.

Use ampersands spar­ing­ly, un­less in­clud­ed in a prop­er name.

In a doc­u­ment longer than three pages, one ex­cla­ma­tion point is plen­ty (see ques­tion marks and ex­cla­ma­tion points).

Use proper trade­mark and copy­right symbols—not al­pha­bet­ic approximations.

Put a non­break­ing space after para­graph and sec­tion marks.

Make ellipses us­ing the prop­er char­ac­ter, not pe­ri­ods and spaces.

Make sure apostrophes point downward.

Make sure foot and inch marks are straight, not curly.
