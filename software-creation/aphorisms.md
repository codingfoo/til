# Software Creation Aphorisms

Write software that anticipates change, not that anticipates specific changes.

A tenet of design is that things that are the same should be obviously the same, and things that are different should be obviously different.

A bug is a failure in the process not a failure in the developer.

Why do rewrites fail? there is much more knowledge in the code than we realize

Why functional over oo
Functional means you are reusing the same datatypes (eg lists, strings, etc)
where in OO you are creating new datatypes

comments should answer why...avoids getting out of date with the code

prefer styles that are error resistant
eg always using braces with if statements

existing code is a hidden input into adding features, it is not just the requirements


People very rarely need estimates. They want a sense of control. They want to manage risk. They want to convince people that money is being well spent. They want to avoid looking like fools. If you solve those problems without using estimates, people generally stop caring.
