# Software Creation Aphorisms

Write software that anticipates change, not that anticipates specific changes.

A tenet of design is that things that are the same should be obviously the same, and things that are different should be obviously different.

A bug is a failure in the process not a failure in the developer.

Why do rewrites fail? there is much more knowledge in the code than we realize

Why functional over oo
Functional means you are reusing the same datatypes (eg lists, strings, etc)
where in OO you are creating new objects
