# Software Creation Aphorisms

Write software that anticipates change, not that anticipates specific changes.

A tenet of design is that things that are the same should be obviously the same, and things that are different should be obviously different.

A bug is a failure in the process not a failure in the developer.

Why do rewrites fail? there is much more knowledge in the code than we realize
