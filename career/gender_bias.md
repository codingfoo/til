# Gender Bias

life is messy - meaning there is no one perfect solution, we have not figured out everything

“I am well-intentioned. But I don’t know what I don’t know.”

women are different than(keep in mind to realize that men and woman approach the same thing differently), This is why this is a challenge and one reason why it is important and valuable to work on gender diversity. because women are different they will help solve this in a different way, not to mention decency.

some of this applies to diversity of background, religious as well.

there are no absolutes. the general characteristics may or may not apply individually.

KEY TO THIS: treat them as individuals
Dont treat 'girls' as one of the guys. dont treat guys as just one of the guys either.

Need to talk to men about this to help demystify women.

"The point isn’t to blame men. In my view, there has been way too much man-shaming as it is. My aim instead is to demystify women."

"Teach men so that women are demystified. Women need to go beyond just talking to ourselves. It is time to invite men to join the conversation, too."

"I am motivated by more than just not wanting to offend, I want to understand correct principles. I want to understand my own biases. I want to enable others to understand and grow and teach them."


"talk to women so they know and understand how men operate, so they know we are working on figuring things out, in all areas not just in gender diversity"

no one should ever feel harassed, or unsafe


1) when a question is asked, ask for elaboration

2) she is ready for a promotion

3) I have her back, recognize and gratitude

4) deserves a raise but wont ask

5) avoid “benevolent sexism.”, dont qualify comments.
dont remind of sterotypes, dont remind that she is female

6) Dont be afraid to give feedback

I am biased, How to change my or compensate biases?


Why do stay at home moms become more depressed? It is something new that at this time in the history of the earth that women 'stayed at home' and only had to raise children. and did not in some other way contribute to the family welfare.
