# Productivity

managing resources to get to achieve our goals, Achieving outcomes


Our brains our good at making us feel we are productive even if we are not

Before: define your outcome

During: avoid time sinks, how to focus on one thing at a time

After: rest, exercise, celebrate


## Before
define desired outcome
our brain wants to get out of work
cut out intermediate goals that are not necessary to reach final outcome

1. what we thought we wanted was not what we really wanted
2. the thing we thought we wanted is just the first step, shortcutting allows us the get there faster
3. there may be faster ways to get there
4. inner conflict about our desired goals - resolve these to prevent sabotage

A well defined outcome or goal is:
1. A well defined out come is written down
2. be VERY specific, our brains our just in time thinking machines, Boxing technique 2 mins or 2 months
3. how will i know i have it
4. is there a finish line
5. is it within your control - define things in your control
6. make it positive,
7. avoid universals

if I have the outcome what does that give me

look for 20% effort that gives 80%

clear out emotional baggage - allows better focus

exercise: for 15 min write down anything / everything that you need to finish, all open loops
  take action or let go
  i hold on to too many open loops


## During

1. focus, avoid interruptions, distractions, multitasking
  we can't multi-task
  even just the fear of interruptions
  focus on one thing
  self distraction i am good at distracting myself
  when am i actually thinking
  close everything that is not pertinent
  50 min of focus and then 10 min break

  brainwave music, block out external sounds


2. follow your energy, we have a natural rhythm
  patterns of energy
  most creative in morn or night
  afternoon is better for errands etc
  listen to your body

  time-log


## After
1. exercise
  beautiful surrounds enhance creativity
2. get rest
  downtime to not check email
  don't sacrifice sleep for work
3. celebrate
  I did what i set out to do so don't just stress self out by immediately adding another one
