How to ignore a childs behavior

Avoid any talking to your child (Discussions should be saved for after the behavior ends).
No eye contact, facial expression or even positioning of your body towards the child. Even if you are boiling on the inside you must appear cool on the outside.
Don't walk in to another room (they will just follow you) and you need to be able to praise the child as soon as they stop misbehaving.
Do distract yourself, even if you are just pretending. Fold laundry, wipe the counters 50 times, or talk to someone else.
Don't be dramatic about ignoring your child; remain as matter of fact as possible. They will get the hint! If you threaten a consequence, make sure you can follow through.

Things that are gross:
Give them a solution without telling them to stop. eg Do you need a tissue? Do you need a nail clipper?
