What to learn

## How to learn

kaizen always be learning

gets ideas from many people, different types of people, a sound board

Get good sleep


### Learning strategies
mind map
spaced repetition
long form copying
write 25 headers for a blog to create a good one
type out code samples, don't copy and paste code
copy(literal hand write) works of other authors

copy an explanation and then add your own clarifications to learn something you dont understand

make connections
figure out what you dont understand, debug your understanding

be aware that something is possible and where to look it up, so it is unnecessary to continue to look it up.

fenyman method(figure out what you want to know, review, test self, fill in gaps)

1 coverage
2 practice
3 insight

1 getting a general idea of what your learning, an outline of the topic, how the topic is structured
2 practice doing problems
  a) get immediate feedback
  b) be careful of spending too much time grinding, practice problems can highlight lack of understanding
1 and 2 help you know what you dont understand
3 feynman technique - explain to grandma
write down the idea or process you are trying to understand
explain the idea to someone else, teach it to someone else
research what you find you dont know, working on making more connections
define what you dont understand

### learning to code in a new language

one chapter at a time

1 get an idea of what is going on
   an overview

2 type out each code example, dont copy!

3 do the exercises without looking

4 possibly do a personal project

## Teaching

procedures explain each step and why it is needed
formulas explain each part

teach someone else as you want to be taught


The particular intervention we have tried addresses student beliefs by explicitly discussing, for each topic covered, why this topic is worth learning, how it operates in the real world, why it makes sense, and how it connects to things the student already knows.


Teaching a subject is similar:

Baseline Teaching: Cover individual concepts in full-depth, one after another
Progressive Teaching: See the big picture, how the whole fits together, then sharpen the detail
